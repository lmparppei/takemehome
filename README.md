## TAKE ME HOME - digital loneliness

Try the live version here: [www.kapitan.fi/takemehome](http://kapitan.fi/takemehome)

This is an open source version of my Take Me Home experience created using JavaScript, WebGL and [Three.js](http://threejs.org). Trapped on a strangely familiar planet. No way to escape. Enough said.

My background is in graphic design and visual arts so my coding skills are limited and the code might be bit of a mess. I tried to comment the strangest parts of it. 
Hope this might inspire and help others to begin to create something strange and intriguing!

Uses Howler.js and Three.js libraries along with many other things found here and there. Special thanks to mrdoob, alteredq and Sylvain Hittelet for their great work.
